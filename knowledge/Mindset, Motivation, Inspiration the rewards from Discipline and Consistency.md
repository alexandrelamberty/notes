SOUL FILLING

Work your vision

The choices that we have though is either to give up or keep on going

If I can take it I can make it

You just gotta believe you can

The path
If you need to rest
The desire to rest was a weakness
The desire to take the downhill path the easy path

The most powerful tool that you have right know in your life in your body is your mind

Hard work works!

Get things done

Educate yourself

Give no place to guilt, worry, bitterness

Assuming
Assumption is huge disappointment in life

Don’t just aspire to make a living! Aspire to make a difference!

Just because you are doing a lot more doesn’t mean you are getting a lot more done!

Don’t confuse movement with progress.

It’s easy to be great nowadays, because most people are weak!

Became somebody

The days ...
I go anyway
I get it done
I go trough

I really don’t want to hammer on a project, I hammer on the project!

The goals
So have dreams but have goals …
Life goals
Yearly goals
Monthly goals
Daly goals
