## Topology

References
Topology Guides

Decimating ? rocks
Topology for deformable objects

Tri		3 sides
Quad		4 sides
N-Gon 		5 or more sides

Quads tend to give the best results, as the other types of polys can result in “pinching”

If you need to use a tri or n-gone, it is best to use them on a flat surface of your model to avoid the pinchnig effect
