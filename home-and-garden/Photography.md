# Photography

## Exposure

Relation between ISO, Aperture, Shutter speed.


   	ISO – Mesure of sensor’s sensitivity to light.
		Modify Graininess (Noise)

   
	Shutter Speed – Time the shutter is open.
		Modify Motion

	Aperture – Size of the opening in the lens when.
		Modify Depth of field


## ISO

Sensitivity to light. Ex: 100, 200, 400, 800,

Changing the ISO modify the sensitivity to the light and the grain of the picture.

	Lower ISO Reduce the sensitivity to the light and reduce the grain.	
	Higher ISO increase the sensitity to the light and increase grain.


Light – Decrease if bright / Increase if Dark
Grain – Decrease for clear / Increaser for noise
Tripod – Decrease if yes / Increase if not
Moving Subject - Decrease if yes / Increase if not


## Shutter 

Time of exposure of the image. Ex: 1/50, 1/250, 1/1600

Changing the Shutter speed modify the motion of the picture.

	Shorter Shutter speed Decrease the motion.
	Longer Shutter speed Increase the motion.
