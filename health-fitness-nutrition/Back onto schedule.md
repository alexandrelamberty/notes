I have a challenge for you... 

- Set up an alarm for tomorrow morning for 15 minutes earlier to usual. Run for straight 10 minutes and use remaining time in whatever way you want. Do this for a week. 
- After 1st week pull your alarm clock by another 5 minutes. Utilize these 5 minutes in form of post running stretches. Again do this for one full week. 
- For 3rd week add another 5 minutes in morning schedule. Use these 5 minutes to do squats (after the run and before stretching). This is one of the most prolific exercise for legs. 
- For the 4th week add another 5 minutes. By now you are up half an hour earlier than your daily routine. Use these 5 minutes for pushups which is the most prolific upper body exercise. Do this right after your run and before squats.
