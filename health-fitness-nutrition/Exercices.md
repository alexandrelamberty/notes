Intense training periods: (like Christmas Break or Spring Break) or just when I want to pump up my training routine. These are 3 day spreads meaning the whole body is done twice a week instead of once.

Day 2: Thighs/Hamstrings/Calves
Day 3: Back/Biceps

Day 2: Thighs/Hamstrings/Calves

Get in the gym and get out- if you exercise for too long you burn all your carbohydrates stores and you won't have energy to rebuild the muscle. So for your chest... do 3 sets of bench and 3 sets of flies and end with 2-3 sets of push-ups to really exhaust the muscle. If you are not sore the next day...you didn't work hard enough. That's it, then leave the gym this should take no more than 45min.

The next day is back: try doing bent over rows 3 sets of 8-12 and 50 pull ups. Maybe 5 sets of 10, or 6 sets of 8... and then get 1 or 2 more, just get to 50, it doesn't matter how many sets just keep pushing until you get there. Then you're done- leave the gym, drink a protein shake, and 45-60min later, start eating. So maybe get a shower and then eat- eating right after working out is not good.
