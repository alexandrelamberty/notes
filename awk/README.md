# Awk

Text processing and data extraction.

## Scripting

## Implementations

- [nawk]() (“new awk”, an evolution of oawk, the original UNIX implementation),
	used on *BSD and widely available on Linux;
- [mawk](), a fast implementation that mostly sticks to standard features;
- [gawk](), the GNU implementation, with many extensions;
- [Busybox]() (small, intended for embedded systems, not many features).
