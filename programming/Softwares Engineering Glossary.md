Multitier architecture
A multitier architecture seprate the differents process of an information system.
The most common n-tier architecture is the Three-Tier-Architecture composed of the : Presentation, Application and Data tiers.

Presentation Layer
User-interactvity with the application.
User interface
It's represent the visual rendering and interactivity with the application.
Data Validation
The validation of data process consit of validating data to be conform with a Data Type or

Application Layer
Controls of the functionnalities.

Business Logic Layer BLL - Domain Logic Layer
Functional process logic.
Handle information exchange between a Data tier and a Presentation tier.
Model the real life object.
Logical Data Model - LDM
Represent data organization
Business object - Domain object
Domain Model Object
Workflows
Data Access Layer - DAL
Active record pattern
Object relationing mapping

Data access object - DAO
In computer software, a data access object (DAO) is an object that provides an abstract interface to some type of database or persistence mechanism, providing some specific operations without exposing details of the database. It provides a mapping from application calls to the persistence layer. This isolation separates the concerns of what data accesses the application needs, in terms of domain-specific objects and data types (the public interface of the DAO), and how these needs can be satisfied with a specific DBMS, database schema, etc. (the implementation of the DAO).

Data transfert object - DTO

Service Data objects - SDO
to be written later ...

Data
Data storage
Database, file server, file system.
